# About The Project
This is a solo project for me [@SamirChelfat](https://github.com/SamirChelfat) Which Consists of Multiple Parts,
This project's goal is to make a Chatting System that utilizes All of Knowledges and try to improuve in them using Real Experience.

### What I am trying to improuve are the following
 + ``` C ( and in the future C++ ) ``` : Multithreading, and better management of data, and making the best use of one's system capabilities, and better optimisation
 + ``` C# ``` : Improuvement in Desgining, and in WinForms, Overall just Making C# code with Better optimisation.
 X ``` Blazor ```: Blazor will not be implement due it it being too slow and hardware demanding, the appropriate langue to replace the latter has yet to be decided.

## ``` Server Side ```

> + A C (Possibly will be change in the future to C++) based Server application [This Project](https://github.com/SamirChelfat/Spectrom_Server) 

## ``` Client Side ```

> +  A C# based Client for Windows Users [Project Link](https://github.com/SamirChelfat/Spectrom_WinClient) ( Currently Private )
> +  A WebApplication for Universal utilization (Windows / Mac / Linux / Mobile OSes)
